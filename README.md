# TIC-TAC-TOE


Project: Tic-Tac-Toe - Two Player Edition
This project aims to develop a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Players will compete against each other, taking turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbols (X or O).


Project Goals:
*Create a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game board.
*Implement game logic to track player turns, validate moves, and determine the winner.
*Ensure a smooth gameplay experience and visual representation of the board.


Features:
*Two-player mode: This version focuses on player-to-player interaction.
*Game board display: A clear visual representation of the 3x3 grid will be displayed, indicating empty cells and player markings.
*Player input: Players will be able to choose their symbol (X or O) and indicate their move by selecting a cell on the board.
*Move validation: The program will check for invalid moves, such as attempting to mark an already occupied cell.
*Win detection: The program will identify winning conditions (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) and declare a winner.
