# TIC-TAC-TOE


Project: Tic-Tac-Toe - Two Player Edition<br>
This project aims to develop a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Players will compete against each other, taking turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbols (X or O).
<br>

Project Goals:<br>
*Create a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game board.<br>
*Implement game logic to track player turns, validate moves, and determine the winner.<br>
*Ensure a smooth gameplay experience and visual representation of the board.<br>


Features:<br>
*Two-player mode: This version focuses on player-to-player interaction.<br>
*Game board display: A clear visual representation of the 3x3 grid will be displayed, indicating empty cells and player markings.<br>
*Player input: Players will be able to choose their symbol (X or O) and indicate their move by selecting a cell on the board.<br>
*Move validation: The program will check for invalid moves, such as attempting to mark an already occupied cell.<br>
*Win detection: The program will identify winning conditions (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) and declare a winner.<br>
